=== COMPLETE CODE ANALYSIS SUMMARY ===

PRIMARY BLOCKER:
✅ IDENTIFIED: Node.js version 18.20.8 < required 20.9.0
   - Next.js 16 requires Node.js >=20.9.0
   - Application CANNOT start until upgraded
   - Error: "Node.js version '>=20.9.0' is required"

VERIFIED WORKING:
✅ Environment variables configured in .env.local
✅ Package dependencies installed correctly
✅ API route structure correct (auth routes exist)
✅ Import path configuration correct (tsconfig.json)

NEEDS RUNTIME VERIFICATION (after Node upgrade):
⚠️ Environment variables loading in Next.js API routes
⚠️ Import path resolution for JavaScript files  
⚠️ Supabase client initialization
⚠️ API endpoint functionality

CODE QUALITY:
⚠️ Some error handling could be improved
⚠️ Missing API routes for users/events/nations/messages/notifications
⚠️ Socket.io disabled (real-time features not working)

NEXT STEPS:
1. Upgrade Node.js to 20+
2. Run: npm run dev
3. Check for compilation/runtime errors
4. Test API endpoints
5. Review debug logs if issues persist
